## 🧠 **UX Psychology Behind This Order**

### **1. PRIMARY ACTIONS (Top)**
- **Dashboard**: Home base, overview, status
- **Play**: Core functionality, main CTA
- **Why**: Users need immediate access to core features

### **2. PROGRESSION & ENGAGEMENT (High Priority)**
- **Daily Tasks**: Habit formation, daily engagement
- **Achievements**: Gamification, progress tracking
- **Leaderboards**: Competition, social proof
- **Why**: These drive retention and engagement

### **3. ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS (Medium Priority)**
- **Analytics**: Performance tracking, insights
- **Why**: Power users want data, but not everyone needs it immediately

### **4. SOCIAL & COMMUNITY (Medium Priority)**
- **Community**: Social features, discussion
- **Why**: Important for engagement but not core functionality

### **5. MONETIZATION & FEATURES (Lower Priority)**
- **Shop**: Revenue generation
- **Referrals**: Growth mechanism
- **What's New**: Feature announcements
- **Why**: Important for business but shouldn't dominate UX

### **6. USER MANAGEMENT (Bottom Priority)**
- **Profile**: User identity
- **Preferences**: Settings
- **Help**: Support
- **Why**: Necessary but not frequently accessed
