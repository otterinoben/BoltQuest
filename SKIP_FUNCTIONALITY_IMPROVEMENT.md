# ⏭️ Skip Functionality Improvement

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed**
Skipping questions was incorrectly:
- ❌ **Reducing score by 1 point** (losing points)
- ❌ **Counting as incorrect answers** (punishing players)

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **New Skip Behavior:**
- ✅ **No score penalty** - Skipping doesn't lose points
- ✅ **Only affects accuracy** - Skipped questions reduce accuracy naturally
- ✅ **Time penalty remains** - Still lose 5 seconds in quick/classic mode
- ✅ **Better user feedback** - Clear messaging about what skipping does

### **How Accuracy Works Now:**
```tsx
// Accuracy calculation (already correct)
const correctAnswers = gameState.answers.filter(
  (ans, idx) => ans === usedQuestions[idx]?.correctAnswer
).length;
const totalQuestionsAnswered = gameState.answers.length; // Only answered questions
const accuracy = (correctAnswers / totalQuestionsAnswered) * 100;
```

**Example:**
- **10 questions total**
- **Answer 6 correctly, skip 4**
- **Score**: 6 points (no penalty for skipping)
- **Accuracy**: 6/6 = 100% (only counts answered questions)
- **Questions answered**: 6 (skipped questions don't count)

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **Before:**
```tsx
const skipPenalty = 1; // 1 point penalty
score: Math.max(0, prev.score - skipPenalty), // Lose points
description: `-${skipPenalty} point • Counts as incorrect`
```

### **After:**
```tsx
// No skip penalty
// Don't reduce score - skipping doesn't lose points
description: `Skipped • Affects accuracy`
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Players:**
- ✅ **Less punishing** - Can skip difficult questions without losing points
- ✅ **Strategic choice** - Skip hard questions to focus on easier ones
- ✅ **Better learning** - Don't get penalized for not knowing something
- ✅ **Clear feedback** - Understand what skipping does

### **For Game Balance:**
- ✅ **Accuracy still matters** - Skipped questions reduce accuracy
- ✅ **Time pressure remains** - Still lose time for skipping
- ✅ **Strategic gameplay** - Players must decide when to skip vs guess
- ✅ **Fair scoring** - Only penalized for wrong answers, not skipped ones

## 🎉 **Result**

**Skipping is now a strategic tool:**
- **Skip hard questions** → Focus on easier ones
- **Don't lose points** → Only wrong answers lose points  
- **Accuracy decreases** → Natural consequence of skipping
- **Time penalty** → Still encourages quick decisions

This creates a more **player-friendly** and **strategic** gameplay experience! ⏭️✨
