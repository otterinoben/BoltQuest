## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Updated Avatar Options Array**
```tsx
const AVATAR_OPTIONS = [
  { 
    name: "Custom Upload", 
    value: "custom", 
    bg: "bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-100 to-gray-200", 
    icon: "📷",
    type: "custom"
  },
  { 
    name: "Explorer", 
    value: "/assets/images/Explorer Avatar.png", 
    bg: "bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100 to-blue-200", 
    icon: "🧭",
    type: "image"
  },
  // ... 4 more PNG avatars
];
```

### **2. Enhanced Avatar Selection UI**
