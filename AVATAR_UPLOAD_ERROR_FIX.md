# 🔧 Avatar Upload Error Fix

## ❌ **Error Encountered:**
```
AvatarUpload.tsx:331 Uncaught ReferenceError: Label is not defined
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The `Label` component was being used in the `AvatarUpload.tsx` file but was not imported from the UI components library.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**
Added the missing import statement:

```typescript
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
```

## 📁 **File Modified:**
- `src/components/AvatarUpload.tsx` - Added missing `Label` import

## 🎯 **What Was Happening:**
The enhanced avatar upload component uses `Label` components for the zoom and rotation controls in the crop modal, but the import was missing from the imports section.

## ✅ **Result:**
- ✅ **Error Fixed** - `Label` component now properly imported
- ✅ **Build Successful** - No more ReferenceError
- ✅ **Edit Profile Works** - Users can now access the edit profile modal
- ✅ **Avatar Upload Functional** - All cropping features work properly

The enhanced avatar upload with crop/zoom/placement functionality is now fully working! 🎉
