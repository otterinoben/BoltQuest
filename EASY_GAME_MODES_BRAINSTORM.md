# üéÆ BoltQuest Easy Game Modes - Brainstorming Session

## **3 Easy-to-Implement Game Modes**

---

## üéØ **Mode 1: "Lightning Round" ‚ö°**

### **Concept**
Ultra-fast, high-pressure mode where speed is everything. Players get 30 seconds to answer as many questions as possible.

### **How It Works**
- **Timer**: 30 seconds countdown
- **Questions**: Auto-advance every 3 seconds (or when answered)
- **Scoring**: Points for speed + accuracy
- **Difficulty**: Fixed medium difficulty
- **Categories**: All categories mixed

### **Scoring System**
```typescript
const calculateLightningScore = (correct: number, total: number, timeBonus: number) => {
  const accuracy = (correct / total) * 100;
  const speedBonus = timeBonus * 10; // Extra points for quick answers
  return Math.round(accuracy + speedBonus);
};
```

### **UI Elements**
- Large countdown timer (prominent)
- Question counter (1/10, 2/10, etc.)
- Speed indicator (Fast/Medium/Slow)
- Final score with speed breakdown

### **Implementation Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy)
- Reuse existing question system
- Add timer logic
- Simple scoring calculation
- Minimal UI changes

---

## üß† **Mode 2: "Memory Challenge" üß©**

### **Concept**
Test working memory by showing questions briefly, then asking players to recall details.

### **How It Works**
- **Phase 1**: Show question for 5 seconds
- **Phase 2**: Hide question, show multiple choice answers
- **Memory Test**: Players must remember question details
- **Duration**: 10 questions total
- **Categories**: Focus on detail-heavy questions

### **Question Format**
```
Phase 1: "What is the capital of France?"
[5 second timer]

Phase 2: "What was the question about?"
A) Geography
B) History  
C) Science
D) Literature
```

### **Scoring System**
```typescript
const calculateMemoryScore = (correct: number, total: number) => {
  const baseScore = (correct / total) * 100;
  const memoryBonus = correct * 5; // Bonus for memory skills
  return Math.round(baseScore + memoryBonus);
};
```

### **UI Elements**
- Two-phase question display
- Memory indicator (brain icon)
- Recall phase transition
- Memory score breakdown

### **Implementation Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy)
- Modify existing question display
- Add two-phase logic
- Simple state management
- Reuse answer selection

---

## üé≤ **Mode 3: "Lucky Dip" üçÄ**

### **Concept**
Randomized mode where players don't know what's coming next. Mix of question types, difficulties, and bonus rounds.

### **How It Works**
- **Random Elements**: 
  - Question difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
  - Question category (random selection)
  - Bonus rounds (double points, skip question, hint)
- **Duration**: 15 questions
- **Surprise Factor**: Players never know what's next

### **Bonus Rounds**
```typescript
const bonusRounds = [
  { type: 'double', description: 'Double Points Next Question!' },
  { type: 'skip', description: 'Skip This Question' },
  { type: 'hint', description: 'Get a Hint' },
  { type: 'time', description: 'Extra 10 Seconds' }
];
```

### **Scoring System**
```typescript
const calculateLuckyDipScore = (correct: number, total: number, bonuses: number) => {
  const baseScore = (correct / total) * 100;
  const bonusMultiplier = 1 + (bonuses * 0.2); // 20% bonus per bonus used
  return Math.round(baseScore * bonusMultiplier);
};
```

### **UI Elements**
- Random category/difficulty indicators
- Bonus round animations
- Surprise element reveals
- Lucky score multiplier

### **Implementation Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy)
- Add randomization logic
- Create bonus round system
- Simple multiplier scoring
- Fun surprise animations
