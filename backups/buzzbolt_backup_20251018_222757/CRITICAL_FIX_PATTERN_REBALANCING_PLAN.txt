üö® CRITICAL FIX: QUESTION ANSWER PATTERN REBALANCING - COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document provides a comprehensive plan to fix the critical issue of predictable
answer patterns in BuzzBolt questions. The current system makes the game unfun and
predictable because the correct answer is always the longest/most detailed option.

CRITICAL ISSUE ANALYSIS
-----------------------
üö® CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Correct answer is ALWAYS the longest/most detailed option
- Wrong answers are obviously wrong (too short/simple)
- Players can guess correctly without knowing the actual answer
- Game is completely predictable and unfun
- No learning value or challenge

üìä PATTERN EXAMPLES:
‚ùå BAD (Current):
- Correct: "Delivery of computing services over the internet"
- Wrong: "Physical server storage"
- Wrong: "Network security system"

‚úÖ GOOD (Target):
- Correct: "Computing services delivered over internet"
- Wrong: "Physical server storage systems"
- Wrong: "Network security monitoring tools"

TARGET SOLUTION
---------------
üéØ Core Requirements:
1. All answer options should be similar length (6-12 words)
2. All options should sound equally plausible
3. Wrong answers should be realistic distractors
4. Correct answer position should be randomized
5. No obvious patterns or predictability

üéØ Quality Standards:
- Similar word count across all options
- Professional terminology in all options
- Realistic business/tech concepts as distractors
- No "obviously wrong" answers
- Balanced difficulty across all options

ROLLBACK PLAN
================================================================

If implementation fails:
1. Revert to previous working version
2. Identify specific step that caused issues
3. Fix issues in isolation
4. Re-implement step by step
5. Test thoroughly before proceeding

BACKUP STRATEGY:
- Commit code after each successful step
- Create feature branch for pattern fixes
- Test each step before proceeding to next
- Keep original mockData.ts as backup
